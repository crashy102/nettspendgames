# nettspendgames

host for nettgames (it's not live yet)<br>
feel free to nab these<br>
my school doesn't block github.io<br>
if yours does then find a provider that isn't blocked and reupload them there<br>

>[!WARNING]
>THE SITE DOESN'T HAVE NAVIGATION, WE JUST USE GOOGLE SITES<br>
>IF U WANNA DIRECTLY ACCESS A GAME YOU'LL HAVE TO MANUALLY GET THE LINK<br>
>JUST NAVIGATE MAIN BRANCH IT'S EASY<br>
